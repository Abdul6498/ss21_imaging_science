Order of parameters: sigma T1 T2
b)
canny objects.pgm objects_output.pgm 2 2 3
we choose a low blurring degree, low T1 and low T2 because the objects and background are quite uniform and edges are easily detectable

c)
canny pruebab1.pgm pruebab1_output.pgm 5 2 3
we choose a high blurring degree because the image is highly noisy. Low T1 and T2 are still sufficient because the edges are easily detectable.

d) (not required but we explained anyway)
canny peppers.pgm peppers_output.pgm 3 3 4
we choose a moderate blurring degree because the image is not very noisy. A higher T1 and T2 than previous cases remove trivial edges such as creases or folds on the surface of the fruits.
